              <p>The Online Journal of Education (OJE) publishes manuscripts that have been peer-reviewed. Thus, our review process entails having independent referees who are conversant with the subject matter review the manuscripts that have been submitted to OJE. 
                Authors are therefore encouraged to strive for maximum clarity of ideas, thoughts, and expression, as the purpose of publication is the disclosure of technical knowledge that should be void of excessively complex or poorly constructed sentences.
                Manuscripts submitted for assessment should have been subjected to editing by an English editor.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The managing editor scrutinizes the submissions of the reviews in order to determine the status of the manuscripts before forwarding the recommendations to the author of the manuscript and notifying him or her of the status of the scripts. The status of the manuscript may be
                ●	Accepted for publication as is   <br>
                ●	Accepted for publication with minor<br>
                ●	changes, with no re-review necessary<br>
                ●	Accepted for publication after substantial revision and additional review<br>
                ●	Rejected<br>
                
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The submissions of the anonymous reviewers will be forwarded to the authors. The author are required to indicate the areas they have changes or corrected in their revised edition as a result of the submissions of the anonymous reviewers with a color. 
                Author are free to stand on their previous submission but must reasons why they have not made the suggested changes proposed by the anonymous reviewers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              
              <p>However, manuscripts which has been previously published, or accepted for publication will not be accommodated by OJE.
                Acceptance of publication of papers in OJE shall not be impeded by other unnecessary criteria and procedures beyond those contained in the review process.
                The editorial board of OJE is committed to a thorough but quick review process of the manuscripts, but not with the sacrifice of the right judgment of a paper. In all, the review process takes maximum two weeks.
