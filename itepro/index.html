        <p>This study examined the disposition of postgraduate students towards career in Sociology.<br>
          A total of four hundred (400) respondents were randomly selected from eight (8) public secondary<br>
          schools in Abeokuta metropolis. Data were generated through the use of both questionnaire and oral<br>
          interviews. Data generated through questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive technique such as<br>
          frequency counts and percentage while the data obtained through interviews were content analysed.<br>
          The study revealed among others that majority of the respondents intend to enroll for tertiary<br>
          educational degree/diploma after completion of their secondary school education. Despite this, it was<br>
          revealed that majority of the respondents were ignorant of the discipline of sociology and this<br>
          accounted for its low preference among the respondents as only 35.5 percent showed positive<br>
          disposition towards career in sociology while 63.7 percent preferred studying other courses and the<br>
          remaining 0.8 percent were neutral. The study concludes with a set of recommendations which will help<br>
          to popularize the course as well as arouse the interest of students in the discipline of sociology.</p>
