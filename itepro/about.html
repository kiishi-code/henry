          <p>
            Olumo Journal of Education provides a platform for academicians, educators, practitioners, and professionals from all walks of life, including emerging scholars and researchers such as students, to share knowledge in the form of innovative ideas, insights, literature reviews, theoretical papers, and empirical research findings with case studies that can be used as resource material to solve problems in all walks of life.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            The journal accepts manuscripts from all fields of study (be it the arts, social sciences, commercial, engineering, sciences, etc.), but they must be education-related. Other manuscripts that are purely educationally inclined, such as those in adult and non-formal education, early childhood education, educational leadership, foundations and management, education technology, educational psychology, guidance and counseling, primary education studies, special education, and pedagogy, are accepted for review and publication.
